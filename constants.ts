**Privacy Policy for Gvail**

Last updated: October 26, 2023

At Gvail, accessible from our web application, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Gvail and how we use it.

**1. Information We Collect**
Gvail operates on a strict "no-logs" policy regarding your personal identity. We do not require you to sign up, provide a name, phone number, or your real email address. 
- **Temporary Emails:** The email addresses generated are temporary. The content of the emails received is stored on the Mail.tm servers and is accessible only to you via the generated authentication token stored locally on your device.
- **Local Storage:** We use your browser's Local Storage to save your current temporary email session and application preferences (such as Dark Mode). This data resides solely on your device and is not transmitted to our analytics servers.

**2. How We Use Your Information**
The information we handle is strictly functional:
- To generate a temporary email address for your use.
- To display incoming messages in your inbox.
- To maintain your interface preferences.

**3. Data Retention**
- **Emails:** Emails are processed by the Mail.tm API. Please refer to their data retention policy. Generally, temporary emails and their contents are deleted automatically after a set period or when you explicitly click "Delete Mail" within the app.
- **Session Data:** Your session data persists on your device until you clear your browser cache or click "Delete Mail" in the app.

**4. Third-Party Services**
We utilize the Mail.tm API for email functionality. By using Gvail, you acknowledge that data transmission occurs between your client and the Mail.tm infrastructure. We do not control and are not responsible for the content of the emails you receive.

**5. Cookies**
Gvail does not use tracking cookies for advertising purposes. We use local storage mechanisms strictly for maintaining app state (keeping you logged in to your temp mail) and UI themes.

**6. Security**
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

**8. Contact Us**
If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us via the Contact section in the app.
